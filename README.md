## Blackjack Project

_Skill Distillery Week 3 Homework Project_

### Overview

This game lets you play blackjack against a computer generated dealer. You can hit or stay, and then choose to quit or play another game.

### Design

I used a class for the dealer hand and a class for the player hand, as well as a game app, game launcher, abstract hand class, deck, and card.

The deck uses the card class to create an a card object of each rank and suit and then fills the deck with them, then the hands remove cards from the deck and put them in the hand.
